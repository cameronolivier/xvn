# Tasks for Branch: main

**Created:** 2025-10-01
**Context:** Planning and documentation for Milestone 4 (Version Activation & Auto-Install)

---

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan for Milestone 4
- ✅ Defined 8 implementation tasks with detailed steps
- ✅ Fixed critical issues identified in review:
  - AutoInstaller lifetime/ownership (use references not Box)
  - stdin injection for testability (prompt_with_stdin method)
  - Clarified idempotency task (already implemented in M3)
  - Added missing structured error handling task (M4.7)
  - Added code quality checks task (M4.8)
  - Specified MockCommandWriter location
- ✅ Validated architecture alignment with ARCHITECTURE.md
- ✅ Verified all prerequisites from M1-M3 are in place
- ✅ Defined comprehensive test strategy (unit, integration, manual, performance)
- ✅ Set success criteria (>85% coverage, <100ms activation)

## Plan Summary

### Milestone 4 Tasks

1. **M4.1: Extract activation logic into dedicated module**
   - Create `src/activation/` module structure
   - Refactor existing CLI code into ActivationOrchestrator
   - Define ActivationResult enum

2. **M4.2: Implement core activation orchestration**
   - Complete activation flow: find version → check installed → handle missing
   - Auto-install mode handling (prompt/always/never)
   - Command generation and FD:3 writes

3. **M4.3: Implement auto-install prompt UI**
   - Interactive prompt with stdin reading
   - Testable design with prompt_with_stdin method
   - User choice parsing (Y/n with sensible defaults)

4. **M4.4: Verify and test idempotency implementation**
   - Review existing XVN_ACTIVE_FILE logic in shell/xvn.sh (lines 54-57, 81, 96-99)
   - Add integration tests for idempotency behavior
   - Note: Implementation already complete in M3

5. **M4.5: Implement version mismatch detection**
   - Get current Node.js version via `node --version`
   - Compare to required version
   - Format user-friendly mismatch message

6. **M4.6: Improve error messages with actionable guidance**
   - Create structured error types (ActivationError enum)
   - Add actionable hints for each error type
   - Update CLI to display helpful error messages

7. **M4.7: Unit tests for activation module**
   - Create MockCommandWriter in src/shell/fd3.rs
   - Test all activation paths (installed, missing, no file)
   - Test auto-install modes and user choices
   - Target >85% coverage

8. **M4.8: Integration tests for activation flow**
   - End-to-end tests with real filesystem
   - Mock plugins for speed and reliability
   - Test nested version files, priority ordering
   - Performance test (<100ms target)

## Files Modified

- ✅ Created: `spec/milestone-4/PLAN.md` (1090 lines)
- ✅ Updated: `spec/milestone-4/TASKS.md` (added M4.7, M4.8, clarified M4.4)

---

## Review Summary

**Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (after fixes applied)

**Review Score:** 85/100 → 100/100 (after fixes)

### Critical Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ AutoInstaller lifetime issue - changed from Box to &'a references
2. ✅ stdin mocking - added prompt_with_stdin method for testability
3. ✅ Idempotency confusion - clarified as verification task (already implemented)
4. ✅ Missing error handling - added M4.7 to TASKS.md
5. ✅ MockCommandWriter location - specified in Task 7 to add to src/shell/fd3.rs

### Strengths:
- Detailed code examples for every task
- Clear module structure and separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test strategy
- Architecture alignment validated
- All prerequisites from M1-M3 confirmed ready

---

## Next Steps

**For Implementation:**
1. Start with M4.1 (module structure) - fully specified and ready
2. Follow with M4.2 (orchestration) - core logic well-defined
3. Apply fixes from review (AutoInstaller, stdin mocking)
4. Complete remaining tasks in order (M4.3-M4.8)

**Success Criteria:**
- All automated tests pass
- >85% test coverage
- <100ms activation time (P95)
- No clippy warnings
- All error cases handled gracefully

---

## Notes

- Milestone 3 is complete (shell integration, FD:3 protocol, setup command)
- `xvn activate` command has basic structure (src/cli.rs:71-138) but needs refactoring
- PluginRegistry::find_available_plugin() exists and returns Arc<dyn VersionManagerPlugin>
- Idempotency is already implemented in shell/xvn.sh (lines 54-57, 81, 96-99)
- All required crates already in Cargo.toml (no new dependencies)

**Plan is complete and ready for milestone 4 implementation!**
