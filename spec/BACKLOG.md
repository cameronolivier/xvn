# List of small tasks, refactors or tech debt
 to be done when we have time

- [x] Fix the command in README - to reference running 'init'  instead of 'setup'
- [x] Alias the 'setup' command to 'init' and remove all specific 'setup functionality' - it should only be an alias
- [x] Change the `anvs:` when the switching runs to: "Automatic Node Version Switcher <new line>âœ“ Switched to..."
- [x] Change the color of "Automatic Node Version Switcher" in the CLI to a better brand color
- [ ] Clean up the wizard - it needs to be tighter. ideally we have a better interface.
