## Implementation Tasks

### Task 12.24: Verify GitHub Release

**Goal**: Check that GitHub Release was created properly.

**Commands**:
```bash
# View release
gh release view v2.0.0

# View release on web
echo "Visit: https://github.com/olvrcc/anvs/releases/tag/v2.0.0"

# List release assets
gh release view v2.0.0 --json assets -q '.assets[].name'
```

**Expected Assets**:
```
anvs-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
anvs-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
anvs-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
anvs-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

**Web Verification**:
Visit https://github.com/olvrcc/anvs/releases/tag/v2.0.0 and verify:
- [ ] Release title: "v2.0.0"
- [ ] Release marked as "Latest"
- [ ] All 4 platform binaries attached as assets
- [ ] Asset names correct (anvs-*, not xvn-*)
- [ ] Release notes present (auto-generated or manual)
- [ ] No draft or pre-release status

**Actions**:
- [ ] GitHub Release created
- [ ] All platform assets present
- [ ] Asset names correct
- [ ] Release is public and marked as latest

---

### Task 12.25: Update Release Notes

**Goal**: Add detailed release notes to GitHub Release.

**Edit the release** on GitHub or via CLI:

```bash
gh release edit v2.0.0 --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
# v2.0.0 - Rename to ANVS üéâ

**BREAKING CHANGE**: This project has been renamed from `xvn` to `anvs` (Automatic Node Version Switcher).

## What's New

- **New Package Name**: Now available as `anvs` (unnamespaced on npm)
- **Better Name**: "Automatic Node Version Switcher" clearly describes the tool's purpose
- **Same Great Features**: All functionality from xvn carried over
- **Improved Discoverability**: Easier to find on npm and Homebrew

## Breaking Changes

This is a major version bump due to the rename. Changes include:

| Old (xvn)                | New (anvs)               |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `@olvrcc/xvn`            | `anvs`                   |
| `xvn` binary             | `anvs` binary            |
| `~/.xvn/` directory      | `~/.anvs/` directory     |
| `~/.xvnrc` config        | `~/.anvsrc` config       |
| `.xvn.yaml` project file | `.anvs.yaml` project file|
| `XVN_*` env vars         | `ANVS_*` env vars        |

## Installation

### New Users

**npm**:
```bash
npm install -g anvs
anvs setup
```

**Homebrew**:
```bash
brew install olvrcc/anvs/anvs
anvs setup
```

### Migrating from XVN

See the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/olvrcc/anvs/blob/main/docs/XVN_TO_ANVS_MIGRATION.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick migration**:
```bash
# Uninstall old xvn
xvn uninstall

# Install new anvs
npm install -g anvs
anvs setup

# Copy config (if you had custom settings)
cp ~/.xvnrc ~/.anvsrc
```

## What Happened to XVN?

- The old `@olvrcc/xvn` package remains available and will continue to work
- Version 1.7.0 includes a deprecation notice
- No new features will be added to `xvn`
- All future development will be on `anvs`

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered after final release:

### npm Issues
```bash
# Publish emergency patch
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch
npm pack
npm publish --otp=<2FA_CODE>

# Deprecate broken version
npm deprecate anvs@2.0.0 "Critical issue found, please use 2.0.1"
```

### Homebrew Issues
```bash
# Update formula to point to fixed version
cd /path/to/homebrew-anvs
# Edit Formula/anvs.rb to use v2.0.1
git add Formula/anvs.rb
git commit -m "fix: update to v2.0.1"
git push
```

### GitHub Release Issues
```bash
# Create new release with fixes
gh release create v2.0.1 --title "v2.0.1 - Critical Fixes"
# Upload corrected assets
# Update release notes
```

### Documentation Issues
- Update README.md and other docs
- Commit and push changes
- Request review if needed

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Release notes don't display correctly
